## Announcement

The latest build of the platform is currently still in Alpha utilizing ASP.NET 6.0 and React.js. Use of Bugit will be detailed when a beta release is available.

## Issues

Please open any issues within the GitHub repository as they are observed or if anything is missing or needed clearer documentation.

## Viewing Front-End Locally / Installation

Use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) to install needed dependencies to view the front-end locally.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Bugit is a web app that is based off the backend framework ASP.NET 6.0 and utilizes React.js for the front-end UI.

In order to run the program you will need to have an IDE that can run ASP.NET 6.0 such as Visual Studio 2022. To run the front-end you will need a javascript/HTML/css editor such as Visual Studio Code.

With the front-end communicating with the back-end the project utilizes the Swagger API to interact with end-points to test them for functionality.
